This is a simple to-do program to dust off my coding skills and get back into it.
My goal with this program is to incorprate HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  While focusing mostly on javascipt and the logic needed.
This project will be using vanilla javascript.

As well as the above, one of my goals is to get back into using Git, and to lear more about it to become better at it than what I was.
